Usage
=====

The general usage workflow for creating new tickets is:

* Create a JiraTicket, RTTicket, RedmineTicket, BugzillaTicket
  or ServiceNowTicket object with ``<url>``, ``<project>`` and ``<auth>``. This
  verifies that you are able to properly authenticate to the ticketing tool.
  To use HTTP Basic Authentication, the ``<auth>`` parameter should contain the
  username and password specified as a tuple. For tools that support kerberos
  authentication (JIRA and RT), the ``<auth>`` parameter should contain
  'kerberos'.
* Create a ticket with the ``create()`` method. This sets the ``ticket_id``
  instance variable, allowing you to perform more tasks on the ticket.
* Add comments, edit ticket fields, add watchers, change the ticket
  status, etc on the ticket.
* Close ticket Requests session with ``close_requests_session()``.

To work on existing tickets, you can also pass in a fourth parameter
when creating a Ticket object: ``<ticket_id>``. The general workflow for
working with existing tickets is as follows:

* Create a JiraTicket, RTTicket, RedmineTicket, BugzillaTicket
  or ServiceNowTicket object with ``<url>``, ``<project_key>``, ``<auth>`` and
  ``<ticket_id>``.
* Add comments, edit ticket fields, add watchers, change the ticket
  status, etc on the ticket.
* Close ticket Requests session with ``close_requests_session()``.

There is also a ``set_ticket_id()`` method for a Ticket object. This is
useful if you are working with a Ticket object that already has the
``<ticket_id>`` instance variable set, but would like to begin working
on a separate ticket. Instead of creating a new Ticket object, you can
simply pass an existing ``<ticket_id>`` in to the ``set_ticket_id()``
method to begin working on another ticket.

To return the current Ticket object's ticket_id or ticket_url, use the
``get_ticket_id()`` or ``get_ticket_url()`` methods.

To run unit tests in Bash terminal use this command:
``python3 -m unittest discover ./tests/``

See the docstrings in the code or the tool-specific files in the docs
and examples directories for more information.

Note on logging: To enable debug logging for ticketutil, set an environment
variable named TICKETUTIL_LOG_LEVEL to 'DEBUG'. You may specify the following
log levels using this environment variable: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR,
CRITICAL. If this environment variable does not exist, the log level will be
set to INFO by default.
