Installation
============

Install ticketutil with ``pip install ticketutil``.

ticketutil is compatible with Python 2.7, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, and 3.6.
Note: For Python 2.6 and lower, an additional package, importlib, may
need to be installed.

If not installing with pip, a short list of packages defined in the
requirements.txt file need to be installed. To install the required
packages, type ``pip install -r requirements.txt``.
